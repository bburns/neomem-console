I'm trying to figure out how to handle types - Neomem needs to understand a set of basic types, and to translate between those and each datasource's types.

e.g. Chrome Bookmarks have a 'date_added' field, which is based on the year 1601. We'll need to translate that to the 'created' field, which is an ISO datestring like '2021-02-08', and vice-versa.

We could store a library of these datatypes, usable by different datasources. e.g. 'date1601', in case some other datasource needed it also.

Put this in neomem-util? neomem-types? neomem-data?

Types need to be dynamic, as with neo4j - user will be able to define new types/labels as needed, and they can contain fields, or relations with other nodes.
